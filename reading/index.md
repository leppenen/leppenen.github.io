# üìö Reading and Listening List

## Reason to share:
I am attaching some scientific, fiction, and non-fiction books that I use/enjoy or that have impacted my personality. I also used to run my reading club "Ded Poest" with my friends, initially aimed for modern Western literature, but then some russian authors were added. I am attaching the list of the books we read in the book club in 2022-2023 here, just as a reminder for myself and maybe the motivation to run the reading club again. Nowadays, I mostly listen to podcasts or audiobooks instead of reading, so I am attaching a list of the selected podcasts with some reviews of the selected episodes. 


## Quantum Physics
- *Quantum Optics* by Scully & Zubairy  
- *The Feynman Lectures on Physics*  
- "Measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits" ‚Äì [arXiv:1901.09980](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09980)

## Lex Fridman Podcast episodes 
I must say I am enjoying the Lex Fridman podcast, and it motivates me for many things (tbh for this webpage as well) 

- *419: Sam Altman* So much hyped... Does he ever know where it is all going? I've heard about AGI from this podcast for the first time, and for sure, it could replace me. After this podcast, I defined the following problem: How to be a post-ChatGPT theoretical physicist? I have my own opinion and also a couple of ideas from my colleagues and friends. Maybe I will write about it more, and I will also be happy to discuss it with whoever is reading it right now.
- *459: DeepSeek, China, TSMC, Megacluster ...*
- *442: Donald Trump Interview*
- *234: Stephen Wolfram: Complexity*
