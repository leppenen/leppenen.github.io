# 📚 Reading and 🎧 Listening List

## Reason to share:
I’m sharing a selection of 📚 *scientific*, *fiction*, and *non-fiction* books that I use, enjoy, or that have meaningfully shaped my thinking and personality.

For a while, I also ran a reading club with friends called **“Ded Poest”** 📖☕ — originally focused on <span style="background-color: #ffffcc;">*contemporary Western literature*</span>, but later expanded to include some <span style="background-color: #ffe0e0;">*Russian classics*</span>.  
I’ve included the list of books we read in **2022–2023** 🗓️ as a reminder and as motivation to possibly rerun the club.

These days, I mostly listen to *podcasts* and *audiobooks* instead of reading 🎧👂.  
Below is a curated list of my favorite podcast episodes, along with some short reviews and reflections 💭✨.



## 🎙️🤖🧠🖤 Lex Fridman Podcast episodes 
I must say I am enjoying the Lex Fridman podcast 🎙️, which motivates me for many things (tbh for this webpage). I want to write a short review of each episode I liked. 

Then I asked myself: Why do I like some episodes and some do not? Well, the answer for me is trivial- because they are *boring*—*boring people, boring questions, boring or annoying guests' voices*. I was excited to listen to a 5-hour podcast about DeepSeek, even though it took me two weeks to finish it, and I didn't understand more than half of the technical details they were talking about. It was interesting for me! But I understand it could be the most boring task to do for a lot of people that I know. So, the point I am trying to make is that *I like everything that is not boring for me* 😄

- *419: Sam Altman* So much hyped... Does he ever know where it is all going? I've heard about AGI from this podcast for the first time, and it could surely replace me. After this podcast, I defined the problem: **How to be a post-ChatGPT theoretical physicist?** I have my opinion and some ideas from my colleagues and friends. I may write about it more, and I'd be happy to discuss it with whoever is reading.
- *459: DeepSeek, China, TSMC, Megacluster ...*
- *442: Donald Trump Interview*
- *234: Stephen Wolfram: Complexity*
- *461: ThePrimeagen* Good idea: always take some time to understand the software/language you are using better, and it will save you time in the future


## 🪆📖💭🖋️ Favourite Russian classics 
Reading was an important part of my education and had great value in my family. Here is my rating list TOP10 of the russian classics.
1. *Doctor Zhivago* by Boris Pasternak
2. *Anna Karenina* by Leo Tolstoy (I also like the movie with Keira Knightley)
3. *Heart of a Dog* by Mikhail Bulgakov (the classic russian movie is really cool! I was even in a lecture with a director and asked him a question :) )
4. *The Fatal Eggs* by Mikhail Bulgakov
5. *Crime and Punishment* by Fyodor Dostoevsky
6. *The Master and Margarita* by Mikhail Bulgakov (ofc) 
7. *The Kreutzer Sonata* by Leo Tolstoy (not famous or popular) 
8. *Fathers and Sons* by Ivan Turgenev
9. *Caucasus* & *The Gentleman from San Francisco* by Ivan Bunin
10. *The Duel* by Aleksandr Kuprin

My close friend Dmitro used to describe my lifestyle with the word **Pelevenshina**. I do not have any idea what it means, but I suggest you read the book *Generation P* by Victor Pelevin if you are interested (maybe even the movie has an English translation or subtitles)
