# üìö Reading List

## Reason to share:
I am attaching some scientific, fiction, and non-fiction books that I use/enjoy or that have impacted my personality. I also used to run my reading club "Ded Poest" with my friends, initially aimed for modern Western literature, but then some russian authors were added. I am attaching the list of the books we read in the book club in 2022-2023 here.
