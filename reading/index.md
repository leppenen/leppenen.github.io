# üìö Reading and Listening List

## Reason to share:
I am attaching some scientific, fiction, and non-fiction books that I use/enjoy or that have impacted my personality. I also used to run my reading club "Ded Poest" with my friends, initially aimed for modern Western literature, but then some russian authors were added. I am attaching the list of the books we read in the book club in 2022-2023 here as a reminder for myself and the motivation to rerun the reading club. Nowadays, I mostly listen to podcasts or audiobooks instead of reading, so I am attaching a list of the selected podcasts with some reviews of the selected episodes. 


## Quantum Physics
- *Quantum Optics* by Scully & Zubairy  
- *The Feynman Lectures on Physics*  
- "Measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits" ‚Äì [arXiv:1901.09980](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09980)

## Lex Fridman Podcast episodes 
I must say I am enjoying the Lex Fridman podcast, which motivates me for many things (tbh for this webpage). I want to write a short review of each episode I liked. Then I asked myself: Why do I like some episodes and some do not? Well, the answer for me is trivial- because they are boring‚Äîboring people, boring questions, boring or annoying guests' voices. I was excited to listen to a 5-hour podcast about DeepSeek, even though it took me two weeks to finish it, and I didn't understand more than half of the technical details they were talking about. It was interesting for me! But I understand it could be the most boring task to do for a lot of people that I know. So, the point I am trying to make is that I like everything that is not boring for me üòÑ

- *419: Sam Altman* So much hyped... Does he ever know where it is all going? I've heard about AGI from this podcast for the first time, and it could surely replace me. After this podcast, I defined the problem: How to be a post-ChatGPT theoretical physicist? I have my opinion and some ideas from my colleagues and friends. I may write about it more, and I'd be happy to discuss it with whoever is reading.
